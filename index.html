            <ul class="for-the-sec-page">

                <li>coerced false confession- A false confession is an admission of guilt for a crime for which the confessor is not responsible. </li>
                <li>Intimidation- acting in a way to make someone else or other scared of you.</li>
                <li>false arrest- False arrest is a common law tort, where a plaintiff alleges they were held in custody without probable cause, or without an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>false imprisonment- False imprisonment occurs when a person intentionally restricts another person’s movement within any area without legal authority, justification or consent.</li>
                <li>falsification of evidence- False evidence, fabricated evidence, forged evidence or tainted evidence is information created or obtained illegally, to sway the verdict in a court case.</li>
                <li>spoliation of evidence- When a person or company withholds, alters, hides, or destroys evidence relevant to the litigation, either intentionally or negligently,...</li>

                <li>police perjury- Police perjury (or testilying in United States police slang) is the act of a police officer giving false testimony. It is typically used in a criminal trial to "make the case" against a defendant believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspect's arrest or search threaten to result in acquittal.It also can be extended further to encompass substantive misstatements of fact for the purpose of convicting those whom the police believe to be guilty, procedural misstatements to 'justify' a search and seizure, or even to include statements to frame an innocent citizen. More generically, it has been said to be "lying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction."</li>
                <li>witness tampering- Witness tampering is the act of attempting to improperly influence, alter or prevent the testimony of witnesses within criminal or civil proceedings.Witness tampering and reprisals against witnesses in organized crime cases have been a difficulty faced by prosecutors; witness protection programs were one response to this problem.</li>
                <li>physical harassment - In general, conduct constitutes physical harassment when it affects an employee’s employment, interferes with his or her performance, or creates a hostile, intimidating, or offensive workplace environment. Examples include touching an employee’s clothing, hair, face, and skin, or making intimidating gestures toward the employee</li>
                <li>police corruption - Police corruption is a form of police misconduct in which law enforcement officers end up breaking their political contract and abuse their power for personal gain. This type of corruption may involve one or a group of officers. Internal police corruption is a challenge to public trust, cohesion of departmental policies, human rights and legal violations involving serious consequences. Police corruption can take many forms, such as bribery.</li>
                <li>racial profiling - acial profiling is the act of suspecting or targeting a person of a certain race on the basis of observed or assumed characteristics or behavior of a racial or ethnic group, rather than on individual suspicion.[1][2] Racial profiling, however, is not limited only to an individual's race, but can also be based on the individual's ethnicity, religion, or national origin. </li>
                <li>unwarranted surveillance - Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, activities, or information for the purpose of influencing, managing or directing. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), or interception of electronically transmitted information, such as Internet traffic. It can also include simple technical methods, such as human intelligence gathering and postal interception.</li>
                <li>unwarranted searches - The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights. It prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. In addition, it sets requirements for issuing warrants: warrants must be issued by a judge or magistrate, justified by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</li>
